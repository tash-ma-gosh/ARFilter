# About This Project

This project allowed me to apply Object Oriented Programming to create a dynamic filter. I treated the face tracker as a class with various attributes. For example, I added a null object as a center axis for the skulls to rotate in an consistent path. To acheive the rotation, I connected the Loop Animation node to the Transition node, which is the built-in  of SparkAR. The time constraints of this project was in the span of two weeks. My final product demonstrates my ability to become familiar with new softwares in a short period of time and apply concepts that I learned from my past computer science courses.
